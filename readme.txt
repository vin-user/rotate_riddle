** NOTE : YOU ARE SEEING THE '&' SIGN NEXT TO SOME NUMBERS  -> IT MEANS THE LETTER IS CAPITAL

*****ATTENTION : THE '2' WHICH ARE SPERATED ARE CONSTANTS. "  DO NOT CHANGE THEM  "

IN A WAY OF CONCLUSION => 1.  THE SEPRATED 2 AND "." AND "/" ARE CONSTANT. DO NOT CHANGE THEM NO MATTER WHAT IS YOUR FUCNTION;
                          2.  THE "&" MEANS THE LETTER IS CAPITAL;
                          3.  BE VERY CAREFULL OF "&";
